<h2>The iPhone 4S - Megapixels aren't everything</h2>

<table width="960" border="0">

<td>The iPhone 4S taughts an improved 8 megapixel digital camera. After reading some 
positive reviews, I was hoping it would suffice for general purpose family pictures.
It certainly would be convenient to have everything all-in-one. So I put it up to the 
test, comparing to our tiny old 3 megapixel Canon PowerShot that my wife has been 
using since 2005. I also compared it to my Sony NEX-5 which isn't really fair, but 
shows what an up-to-date digital camera can do.</td>

<p>In medium light without a flash, the iPhone 4S does a pretty good job of capturing the 
picture. It seems to favor these natural light shots, avoiding its flash in all but the 
most dim conditions. This produces a more natural picture, but the sensor is grainy at these
higher ISO speeds - good for email and web but not for printing. Natural light is also not 
always ideal for pictures of people, yielding unflattering shadowing around facial features.</p>

<p>Meanwhile color balance and metering are very good. But it regularly uses shutter speeds around 
1/15s or 1/20s which is really not practical for hand-held pictures due to motion blur, 
worse if you are trying to take pictures of kids that never stand still. Meanwhile the 
old Canon just can't perform indoors without a flash due to its old sensor with limited
ISO capability.</p>

<p>When a flash is required the iPhone 4S really struggles while a cheap point-n-shoot 
digital camera has no problem. Don't expect to get any detail out of these images. 
Surprisingly, the camera didn't compensate for the flash with a faster shutter speed or
lower ISO, indicating just how feeble the flash really is.</p>
<p><b>Bottom line:</b> the iPhone 4S has a good little camera as far as phones go, but is
no substitute for a dedicated digital camera.</p>
