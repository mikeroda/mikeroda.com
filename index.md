Hi. I am a Application Architect at <a href="http://www.verizon.com">Verizon</a>, 
leading software development projects and designing systems for the company's wireline 
network systems.

<p>I have always been interested in computers and technology, having started programming
on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> - these days I 
prefer to be on a Mac but will accept any flavor of UNIX. In Rochester I was a very early 
adopter in digital photography, a hobby that continues today. I have also been interested 
in flight simulation for a long time, having spent a little too much time as a virtual air 
traffic controller on the <a href="http://www.vatsim.net">VATSIM</a> network, at least 
according to my wife.

<p>These days much of my free time is spent studying Computer Science at 
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a>. As of Dec 2011 I am 
60% done, expecting to graduate with a Masters degree in May 2013. I hold an 
undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the State University of New York, college at 
<a href="http://www.brockport.edu">Brockport</a>, plus a degree in Computer Technology 
and a certificate in Electronic Technology from
<a href="http://www.monroecc.edu">Monroe Community College</a> in Rochester, NY.</p>

<p>You might see me around town in <a href="http://www.apexnc.org">Apex, North Carolina</a> 
with my wife and two daughters.</p>
