Hi. I am a senior technical staff member in systems architecture at 
<a href="http://www.verizon.com">Verizon</a>, leading software development projects 
and architecting systems for the company's wireline network systems.

<p>I am also a part-time graduate student of Computer Science at 
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a> and hold a degree
in Computer Science from the State University of New York, college at 
<a href="http://www.brockport.edu">Brockport</a>, plus a degree in Computer Technology 
and a certificate in Electronic Technology from
<a href="http://www.monroecc.edu">Monroe Community College</a> in Rochester, NY.</p>

<p>You might see me around town in <a href="http://www.apexnc.org">Apex, North Carolina</a> 
with my wife and two daughters, but seldom on days when a good football game is on TV.</p>
